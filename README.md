## Reference textbook
[Ivezić, Connolly, VanderPlas & Gray: Statistics, Data Mining, and Machine Learning in Astronomy:
A Practical Python Guide for the Analysis of Survey Data (Princeton University Press, 2014)](http://press.princeton.edu/titles/10159.html)


## Class Description

This course will introduce students to most common statistical and computer science methods 
used in astronomy and other physical sciences. It will combine theoretical background with 
examples of data analysis based on modern astronomical datasets. Practical data analysis 
will be done using python tools, with emphasis on astroML module (see www.astroML.org). 
While focused on astronomy, this course should be useful to all students interested in data 
analysis in physical sciences and engineering. The lectures will be aimed at undergraduate 
students and the main discussion topics will be based on  Chapters 4 and 5, and selected 
topics from Chapters 6-10, from the reference textbook. 

By taking this course, students will develop basic understanding of topics such as robust 
statistics, hypothesis testing, maximum likelihood analysis, Bayesian statistics, model 
parameter estimation, the goodness of fit and model selection, density estimation and 
clustering, unsupervised and supervised classification, dimensionality reduction, 
regression and time series analysis. Most of these topics will be applied in class homeworks 
to analysis of astronomical data.
